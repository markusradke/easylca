Description: 
  The package is a wrapper around the MplusAutomation package that communicates with the commercial statistical software MPlus 8.4 that is developed by Muthen and Muthen (<https://www.statmodel.com>). easylca is designed to make conducting a mixed LCA in MPlus 8.4 more accessible. MPlus 8.4 is required to be installed for the use of this package. Please refer to the define_lca() function to get started. The package depends on the "rhdf5" package.  Depending on your environment you will need to install the "BiocManager" package first, so that you can install the "rhdf5" package. This can be done with 'install.packages("BiocManager"); BiocManager::install("rhdf5")'.
