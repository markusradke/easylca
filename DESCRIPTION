Description: easylca is an R package designed to make conducting latent class analyses with mixed indicators (LCAs) with Mplus 8.4 more accessible. Mplus is a powerful commercial statistical software package developed by Muthen & Muthen (www.statmodel.com). It is based on text file input and output, and employs its own syntax for model formulation. With easylca, however, there is no need to worry about learning the Mplus syntax. The easylca package is an easy-to-use wrapper around the MplusAutomation package by Hallquist et al. (https://cran.r-project.org/package=MplusAutomation) which communicates with Mplus from within R. However, easylca in addition provides functions that ensure data compatibility and can automatically create and run even the most complex LCAs involving censored, zero-inflated, count or negative binomially distributed variables. Furthermore, easylca includes functions that generate HTML reports for data inspection, model selection and model profile inspection.Be aware that MPlus 8.4 must to be installed on your computer in order to use package and is not installed together with easylca. easylca also depends on the rhdf5 package. Depending on your environment you may need to install the BiocManager package manager first to install the rhdf5 package.
